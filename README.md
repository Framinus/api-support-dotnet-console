- This is a console app with three functions - Get Account, Create Account, and Send Non-Embedded Signature Request.
More functionality will be added as time allows.

- This project uses the HelloSign SDK and RestSharp and was built in Visual Studio.

- You will need to sign up for a HelloSign account and get an API Key, and set the environmental variable API_KEY to this value in order for this code to run.
